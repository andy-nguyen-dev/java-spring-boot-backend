> 
> Download and open up the zip file. Then extract your project folder to wherever you keep your projects.
> 
> Open up Intelij.
> 
> File > New > Module From Existing Sources > Find and Open your project folder
> 
> You should have a bootstrapped Java Spring Boot project that's ready to run. Refer to the "itShouldBeRunnable.png" image in this root directory.
